weather = 'It will be a sunny day today'

print(weather.replace('sunny', 'cloudy'))



#write Python statements corresponding to these assignments:
# (a) To variable count, the number of occurrences of string 'day' in string forecast.
# (b) To variable weather, the index where substring 'sunny' starts.
# (c) To variable change, a copy of forecast in which every occurrence of substring
#'sunny' is replaced by 'cloudy'.
